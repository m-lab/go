	// anonymization.

	// IgnoredIPs is a set of IPs that should be ignored and not anonymized. By
	// default it is the set of local IP addresses. This set should be small, so
	// it is represented as an array because net.IP objects can't be used as map
	// keys.
	//
	// If runtime profiling indicates this causes too much of a slowdown in
	// practice, then the other design that is "near at hand" with Go primitives
	// is to use map[string]struct{} where the string is the IP converted to a
	// string. If that design also causes too much of a slowdown in practice,
	// then we will have to fall back on our algorithms knowledge and build a
	// clever data structure. The 3 main options are:
	//  1. a bloom filter in front of a set object,
	//  2. a 256-ary tree using each successive byte of the IP for each
	//     successive level, or
	//  3. a map[int32]struct{} for v4 addresses and a
	//     map[int64](map[int64]struct{}) for v6 addresses.
	// Likely the last option will be the fastest; ceteris paribus, native ints
	// and language builtins tend to have the best performance.
	//
	// Big-O analysis doesn't buy us much here. There are a small number of
	// local IPs and each one is of length 4 or 16. This means that taking the
	// limit as N goes to infinity doesn't tell us much, because all of the
	// quantities we might call "N" are 16 or less in all realistic scenarios,
	// and 16 is a poor approximation of infinity. Therefore, any claims about
	// relative speed of implementation need to be backed up by experimental
	// evidence.
